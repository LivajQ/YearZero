FLAGS
- maps/non-used seems redundant. Is there anything necessary? Looks like a waste of 120 megabytes. For now deleted cause it was conflicting with base maps
- Are assets in entities/lamp just modified .ent files? If so, everything else can be deleted
- Almost positive the lantern is a copypaste as well. Last modified 2019
- Any purpose of config/lang_main/english.lang.bak?
- Death functions have some curious design where they stop playing the music after 15 deaths. Is that intentional? There is nothing else added past that point
- Nice Minecraft loading screen
- You didn't mention it before but I found the study key this time around. Either the study should be locked or the key removed from the quarters
- Why the hell are your maps named like this
- Sewer has brute chase scripts but no brute in the map
- non-used folder has normally named maps while the main folder is full of test maps. Then again, the very first maps already teleports you to a "test" map so I have no idea what is considered main here
