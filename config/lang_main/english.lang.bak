		<Entry Name="Note_projectyz_Text">The project Year Zero is an opportunity like no other. Lots and lots of time has been spent for preparations, planning and studying. The grande finale is ahead, and I will be giving everything I have on this Earth to succeed.[br][br]Years back, I stumbled upon a tome which on the first glance seemed like a normal tome, though slightly larger in size when compared to others. As I explored it further, it revealed a dozen of secrets for me. The tome had a lot of different instructions, for example how to turn anything into gold and how to gain all the luck and fortune on the planet. I managed to try all these things, with success - but the biggest prize still lies ahead.[br][br]The last chapter of the tome is entirely focused on opening a portal to an alternate universe. This universe is a paradise for all those people who enter the portal, and these people will be provided everything they could ever imagine. Prosperous existence will not be forbidden from anyone, it is a true dreamland.[br][br]To open the portal, four artifacts and items will be required. At first, the artifacts seemed normal, but upon further investigation revealed a connection for all the items - they are all somehow linked to Satanism. A while ago I had no idea about Satanism, but as it was mandatory for me to study it, I did so and learnt about it. It eventually turned me a Satanist, hence me abandoning Christianity.[br][br]After the items have been gathered, twenty souls must be sacrificed for Satan. The amount seemed crazy on the first glance, but it is a small price to pay from such luxury this project will give us. As of now, I do not know how I could get the souls I need, so further investigations are required.[br][br]If everything goes right, and the portal opens, nothing can stop me.</Entry>

        <Entry Name="Note_henry_diary1lol_Name">Henry's Diary #1 - Revelations</Entry>
		<Entry Name="Note_henry_diary1lol_Text">Success![br][br]After all the wasted efforts, failures and misfortune, I managed to grab all the things I need for my project. To say that receiving all of them was a walk in the park would be misleading, as I almost lost my life in the process. Now I can focus on the future, and get this thing going.[br][br]The project Year Zero has now officially started. I have everything I need, aside from the most important thing - people to help me reach my goal. Convincing enough people to join me in this adventure is a lot easier said than done, since the word simply can not spread around the castle, at all. That would put me and two of my most loyal servants, Howard and Collin in a great danger.[br][br]We recently discussed the lack of people, and we came to a conclusion that simply trying to convince others is way too risky for our own sake. However, another method exists - since we are all trained in black magic, witchcraft and other unnatural forces, we could trying brainwashing the people. I am the perfect man for that duty, as I entirely lack any moral ethics and I could not care a bit about what I do.[br][br]Together we invited a few of my friends to come for a visit. Tomorrow we will see how the brainwashing process starts, and if we are to get any success regarding that. I really wish our attempts would be rewarding. It is mandatory at this point.</Entry>
		



		<Entry Name="Note_henry_diary1_Name">Henry's Diary #1 - Revelations</Entry>
		<Entry Name="Note_henry_diary1_Text">The project has now officially started. All the artifacts have been acquired, and most of the preparations are complete. However, the most important thing remains uncertain - where do we get the required souls? I know how to get them - the knife is used for that, but the greatest challenge lies within getting the people to sacrifice. The castle we occupy at the moment is deep within a forest, so getting people here will not be a walk in the park.[br][br]I had a conversation with my friends and servants Howard and Collin, and their ideas were as good as mine. After a while, we came up with a solution for how to get the first souls. Two friends of Collin live within a relatively close proximity, and they would make up for ideal victims to get the first souls. Obviously and understandably, the decision was not easy for Collin - they were his friends after all. I had to remind him about what we are doing here, and why we are doing it. It took him some time to process, but eventually he agreed to the idea.[br][br]I got Collin to invite the friends for a dinner tomorrow, and to our very liking, they accepted the invitation. Tomorrow will be the day we get the first souls, from completely unaware and innocent people. Nothing can go wrong with this - and this is only the beginning.</Entry>
 
        <Entry Name="Note_henry_diary2_Name">Henry's Diary #2 - First Souls Gathered</Entry>
		<Entry Name="Note_henry_diary2_Text">Upon our friends' arrival, we held a few conversations at our living quarters area. As the evening progressed further, we moved to the Library to drink some of the finest wines this entire world has to offer. We had such an amazing time with our friends that we almost entirely forgot the reason we invited them here in the first place - it was time to get going.[br][br]I asked Collin to bring in the specifically marked bottle, filled with drugged drink. We offered the drink, and they took the bait innocently. Few moments after, both fell to the floor, uncouncious. We dragged them to a room close to the older part of the library, and then stabbed them, fatally. The ancient knife I had got two of its twenty gems lit up. Eighteen more to go - slowly but surely. Having broken the floor in the room, we buried the bodies inside the room, and then boarded the entrance. We are not ready to take any risks being caught burying the bodies outside.</Entry>
		
		
	    <Entry Name="Note_ancientknife_note_Name">The Ancient Knife</Entry>
		<Entry Name="Note_ancientknife_note_Text">[br][br][br]The Ancient Knife is one of the four artifacts which are required to open the portal to the alternate universe. The object itself is razor sharp, and it is also covered in incredibly rare gemstones. These gemstones serve an important purpose with opening the portal, as each one of the twenty gems is capable of holding one soul of an individual. To get a soul of a person, the victim must be killed with the knife. After the death of the person, the knife is then stabbed straight to the heart of the individual, and left there to charge. After some time in the heart, the soul is successfully captured and one of the gemstones will light up. The knife is fully charged after twenty of such procedures.[br][br][br][br][br]The origins of the knife are relatively unknown. Some speculate it was brought to the world by Nightscalpers - a kind of demonic creatures who were believed to enter the world straight from the depths of hell, in order to spread satanism to people. Others claim the knife to simply be a regular, fake knife with nothing special on it, a hoax if you wish. [br][br]Aside for the soul gathering, the knife has another purpose with our project. When combined with the natural forces of the Earth, the knife can be used to form electrical barriers to prevent people from entering a location. However, the forces are limited - and as such, only two of these barriers can be enabled at the same time. One of these barriers are kept in the library for extreme privacy reasons - no one shall enter the forbidden room in the Library, or otherwise the Satanic entities will get released to the castle. These entities are believed to follow the one who released them, with so far unknown consequences.</Entry>
        
		<Entry Name="Note_blackdiamond_note_Name">The Black Diamond</Entry>
		<Entry Name="Note_blackdiamond_note_Text">[br]The Black Diamond is one of the four incredibly valuable artifacts for the portal opening. The origins of the jewel are unknown, but some claim it is brought to our world straight from the future. What makes the Black Diamond so rare is both its impressive size for a jewel, and the fact that black diamonds are incredibly rare. The artifact is said to be cursed by unholy forces, to constantly haunt the one carrying it.[br][br]For our project, the diamond is used as a gift for the unearthly forces. Upon getting access to the gem, it is gifted straight for Satan, for him to give us his approval. This is one of the four steps required to open the portal to immortal happiness.</Entry>
        
		<Entry Name="Note_kendrickdiary_Name">Kendrick's Diary 2 - Defeated</Entry>
		<Entry Name="Note_kendrickdiary_Text">This might just be the last ever text I write in my life. I screwed up big time.[br][br]I was so close. I was so damn close to ending this madness. Henry has lost his mind with the Project Year Zero. He does not know the reality anymore, and he can not tell the present from the past. With seventeen souls acquired as I write this, I am bound to become the eighteenth.[br][br]I realised that what we are doing, is not right, for obvious reasons. I figured out I was manipulated to believe in everything that Henry said. There is no paradise, there is no immortality, there is no alternate universe. No matter how much he tries to convince me, or other    servants, it just simply is not true. No one should believe Henry, no one should trust him. He has lost his mind.[br][br][br][br]I got caught trying to crack one of our cursed possessions, the Demon Skull. Without the Skull, they can not progress with their mindless operation. Just as I was trying to break it, Henry caught me. I had no time for excuses. I managed to find my way back here, locking Henry in the Old Archives in the progress. I am very weak and seriously injured. I need to go.</Entry>

These Archives has water damage all over the place, everything is collapsing, and it is all messy inside. I do not understand why this area is used in the first place.

		<Entry Name="Note_kendrick_note_secret_Text">I am slowly but surely starting to second guess myself and my role for the project Year Zero. With the project being around half complete as I am writing this, I have come to realise that this can not be real. The portal, the universe, it just makes.. no sense. I do not believe the Tome of The Other World. Even when Henry tried to convince me its spells worked when he found the Tome, I was very suspicious about it. He lost his temper with me and told me to give him the appropriate time and that I need to stop questioning the project.[br][br]Too many innocent people have died already. I can not be this selfish, and keep on going with such a burden on my shoulders. I need to stop this, for once, and for all. Tomorrow, this will end.</Entry>
		
		
		
		
		//Sewer
		

		<Entry Name="Note_Sewer_Machine_Name">Sewer machinery</Entry>
		<Entry Name="Note_Sewer_Machine_Text">This machinery room was made for operating the flood prevention heavy door system. Sometimes, the northern side of the Sewer would force water out with a high pressure and force, hence resulting in the water overflowing to the eastern side. While this is not a problem by itself, the water would occasionally flood to the underground section cells part. [br][br]It is not recommended to enter the northern side of the sewer, as nothing mandatory for the machinery or for our project lay there. If you must enter the side, beware the possible flooding. </Entry>

        <Entry Name="Note_Sewer_MachineOperating_Name">Operating the machine</Entry>
		<Entry Name="Note_Sewer_MachineOperating_Text">To get the machine to work, ensure that: [br][br]1) The fuel tank is filled. While there is no way to check the amount, the lack of fuel is an obvious indication. Always make sure to spare some extra fuel in the room. [br][br] 2) The machinery requires oil. However, filling the oil tank is not necessary every time, since it will last for quite some while. If you have added the fuel, and the machinery still does not work, consider adding little bit of oil. [br][br]3) The wheel is functional. At times, the wheel which would open the door could either be stuck or spin freely without doing anything. In this case, it is better to restart the entire machine. The cause of this issue is unknown.</Entry>

		<Entry Name="Note_UGSectionNote_Name">The Underground Section</Entry>
		<Entry Name="Note_UGSectionNote_Text">The Underground Section is the area where the majority of our work gets done. The available room means that anything we want to do, is possible here - even the more secretive stuff we have on our hands.[br][br]However, this place has its risks. Few weeks ago, the corridor leading to the second part of the area collapsed, trapping a few of our cult members. As far as we know, there is no alternative way to get out from the area - may the unholy forces free their innocent souls and let them roam free in the perfect world when the time is right. The area is massive, and navigating through the corridors can be tricky, especially during nights when the lanterns are turned off.  </Entry>
		
		<Entry Name="Note_machine_Name">Underground Section machine</Entry>
		<Entry Name="Note_machine_Text">The complex nature of the Underground Section machine is there for a reason - as this is the only barrier between the underground ritual area and the underground section itself. The machine requires eight different rods to start, and afterwards, a correct combination of the levers in the left side is mandatory. Each of our members have their own copies of the correct lever order. This way of keeping our areas private might seem a bit extreme, but we can not afford a single risk for our project's sake.</Entry>

		<Entry Name="Alexander01">One day I will return. If it wasn't for the thought of you, my love, I wouldn't be able to go on. When I find myself doing terrible things, I take comfort in you. [br][br]As long as I am able to think of you and long for a life together, I know I'm better than the others. I weep for them, they lust for power without restraint, where I only crave fair judgment and a safe return.</Entry>
		<Entry Name="Alexander02">When will it be my turn? Have I not shown restraint? My patience spans centuries. From where I came, mankind is not even wasted a breath, yet I bow to you. [br][br]I have done so much for you and I have gained nothing in return. Agrippa, I trusted you. It was I who in all fairness should have entered that gate.</Entry>
		<Entry Name="Alexander03">I fear for Daniel, for he is reckless. He is tainted by the approaching shadow and will not be able to pass the gate. Will he be able to accept this in the end? [br][br]My love, I've seen evil in him. How am I to trust him with the truth? What cruel irony that I have to do unto him what Agrippa did unto me.</Entry>
		<Entry Name="Alexander04">In court, the order of the Black Eagle spew their politics at each other while I sit quietly in place, willfully forgotten. Once in a while someone will notice me and lose themselves in a silent cower before regaining their senses.[br][br]They all know I am the one and the same Alexander who helped their fathers and grandfathers to found this great Order. I've seen them take their fathers' places, and they too will grow old and pass away. While I remain the same, aged not by time, but by anguish.</Entry>
		<Entry Name="Alexander05">Is it you, my love, I miss the most, or is it perhaps myself? I know what I have become, I am not blind. I am a monster to them, a demonic sultan perched on a dark mountain top. There is little I can do to redeem myself.[br] [br]The Black Eagle fears me and after Napoleon's defeat it is only a matter of time before they will demand my head on a platter. I must remove myself from this land. This time it must work. If I can't return home now, I shall perish.</Entry>

		<Entry Name="Ch01_Beginning01">The door slammed shut behind him and he knew he would never again see the old tailor at Berkeley Square. Another lone soul in London - seemed appropriate somehow.</Entry>
		<Entry Name="Ch01_Beginning02">The other children cheered him on. His name voiced in a steadily rising pace, urging him to do it. "Am I really doing this?", the young boy thought and struck his victim with a rock.</Entry>
		<Entry Name="Ch01_Beginning03">He fell to the kitchen floor. Tears were beginning to well in his eyes as he received the first kick in his stomach. Hazel remained hidden, in fear she too would be punished.</Entry>

		<Entry Name="WelcomeMessage01">Welcome to Amnesia: The Dark Descent! [br][br]What follows is a couple of quick messages on how to get the best possible experience.</Entry>
		<Entry Name="WelcomeMessage02">Amnesia should not be played to win. [br][br]Instead, focus on immersing yourself in the game's world and story.</Entry>
		<Entry Name="WelcomeMessage03">Do not worry about when and how to save during gameplay, the game will take care of that for you. [br][br]When you want to leave the game, just choose "Save and Exit". You can then use "Continue" to return to where you left off next time you start up the game.</Entry>
		<Entry Name="WelcomeMessage04">The world of Amnesia is a dangerous place and you are extremely vulnerable. [br][br]Do not try to fight the enemies encountered. Instead, use your wits. Hide, or even run if necessary.</Entry>
		<Entry Name="WelcomeMessage05">The interplay between light and dark is very important to the game and because of this it is vital to set up the gamma correctly. Use the slider control below to do so. Adjust it until the square at the right is barely visible. [br][br]Also make sure to play in a dark room and wear headphones for the best effect.</Entry>
		<Entry Name="WelcomeMessage06">That is all. Hope you enjoy immersing yourself in the world of Amnesia.[br][br][br]- Frictional Games</Entry>
