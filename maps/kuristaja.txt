What makes you mentally ill, what makes you kind
I won't look into your eyes, I'll spread the corpse blanket
In the films, I am the back sheep, under the clothes of the Pink Panther
Janitor comes to fix your electrics, 
I'm the janitor, you're the girl to soon pass away
You walk across me, you look into my eyes, 
I want to fucking rip your tongue out
But I can't, because I love you
Others consider me sick, you go fishing with me
You come in front of me, you do a beatuiful gesture,
I won't look into your eyes but I'll eat your tears
Our eyes will meet at a certain time
Soon you will be at the bottom of my freezer
I will never raise you from there
I have velcgro shoes and ice under them

I won't look into eyes, I won't look into eyes
I wish I could rip your eyes off
I won't look into eyes, because I don't enjoy it
I enjoy if I can slit your throat open

I won't look into eyes, I won't look into eyes
I wish I could rip your eyes off
I won't look into eyes, because I don't enjoy it
I enjoy if I can slit your throat open

My lungs are bursting, my heart is spitting blood
I'll be drifting towards the tar ocean
Every time, no matter what
I'll pierce your chest with a pencil
You look in the mirror, you turn off your faucet,
I'll make a pumpkin mask out of your facial skin
Fucking bitch, a bitch frim the whore bar
The world is an island of cutthroats
Blood comes with pressure, then comes death
The trachea plays me bloody notes
Tomorrow, only a few will be alive
I fish my wish from wishing wells
I'll eat your brain and frontal lobe
I'll strangle you with a hanger or electric cord
I always appear when it's dark
And I will crush your skull with a rock

I won't look into eyes, I won't look into eyes
I wish I could rip your eyes off
I won't look into eyes, because I don't enjoy it
I enjoy if I can slit your throat open

I won't look into eyes, I won't look into eyes
I wish I could rip your eyes off
I won't look into eyes, because I don't enjoy it
I enjoy if I can slit your throat openI won't look into eyes, I won't look into eyes

I wish I could rip your eyes off
I won't look into eyes, because I don't enjoy it
I enjoy if I can slit your throat open

I won't look into eyes, I won't look into eyes
I wish I could rip your eyes off
I won't look into eyes, because I don't enjoy it
I enjoy if I can slit your throat open
